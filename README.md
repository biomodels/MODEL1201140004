# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**Minimal model of beta-cell mitochondrial Ca2+ handling.**   
Magnus G, Keizer J. _Am J Physiol._ 1997 Aug;273(2 Pt 1):C717-33.
[9277370](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9277370) ,  
**Abstract:**   
We develop a simplified, but useful, mathematical model to describe Ca2+
handling by mitochondria in the pancreatic beta-cell. The model includes the
following six transport mechanisms in the inner mitochondrial membrane: proton
pumping via respiration and proton uptake by way of the F1Fzero-ATPase
(adapted from D. Pietrobon and S. Caplan. Biochemistry 24: 5764-5778, 1985), a
proton leak, adenine nucleotide exchange, the Ca2+ uniporter, and Na+/Ca2+
exchange. Each mechanism is developed separately into a kinetic model for the
rate of transport, with parameters taken from experiments on isolated
mitochondrial preparations. These mechanisms are combined in a modular fashion
first to describe state 4 (nonphosphorylating) and state 3 (phosphorylating)
mitochondria with mitochondrial NADH and Ca2+ concentrations as fixed
parameters and then to describe Ca2+ handling with variable mitochondrial Ca2+
concentration. Simulations are compared to experimental measurements and agree
well with the threshold for Ca2+ uptake, measured mitochondrial Ca2+ levels,
and the influence of Ca2+ on oxygen uptake. In the absence of Ca2+ activation
of mitochondrial dehydrogenases, the simulations predict a significant
reduction in the rate of production of ATP that involves a "short circuit" via
Ca2+ uptake through the uniporter. This effect suggests a potential role for
mitochondrial Ca2+ handling in determining the ATP-ADP ratio in the pancreatic
beta-cell.
